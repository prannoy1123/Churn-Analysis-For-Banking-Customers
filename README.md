Out of the number of customers churned, male has a higher percentage.

The overall churn rate is 20.4% which is above the industry rate (8-12%), as per age group, 41-50 has churned the most.

The data also shows that of the customers who are mostly inactive,63.9% have churned as compared to active customers, which means the bank is not giving enough attention to the customers who only have bank accounts and have little to no transactions on a daily basis.

Even the customers who have bank credit card have churned more, reasons could higher surcharges or any other issues which are forcing the customers to go for other banking services.
