Male active bank account holders have reduced after customers have churned out.
The overall churn rate is 20.4% which is above the industry rate (8-12%), the largest contributor in terms of age group is 41-50.

The data also shows that the customers who are mostly inactive,63.9% have churned as compared to active customers, means the bank is not giving enough attention towards the customers who only have the bank accounts and have little to no transactions on daily basis.

Even the customers who has bank credit card have churned more, meaning either the credit card has high surcharges or any other issues which is forcing the customers to go for other banking services.
